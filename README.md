## Installation

    $ gem install capwatch
    $ capwatch

Don't forget to edit `~/.capwatch` with the amount of cryptocurrencies that you hold. Also please change the name of the fund. ðŸ¤”

## Telegram

If you want to get portfolio notifications on demand to your telegram, you'll need:

1. Create a telegram bot via [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots)
2. Get the bot `token`
3. Start capwatch with the bot `token` in hand


        $capwatch -e <bot_token>

Currently Capwatch supports only two commands

- `/watch` - shows the entire portfolio
- `/cap` - shows only the footer of the portfolio, e.g. summaries

Remember to start it on a server in a tmux window or as a daemon.
